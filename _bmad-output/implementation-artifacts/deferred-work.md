# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-project-initialization-infrastructure-setup (2026-05-09)

- `global_fetch_strictly_public` flag in `wrangler.toml` blocks private/loopback IPs — only relevant when using `wrangler dev` against local Supabase; not blocking for CF production. Revisit when local wrangler dev workflow is tested.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` not injected in CI deploy job — wrangler may auto-detect from API token; verify during first actual deploy and add explicit secret if multi-account token is used.
- `instrumentation.ts` Sentry init may not fire on Cloudflare Workers runtime — `NEXT_RUNTIME` checks cover `nodejs` and `edge` but CF Workers via OpenNext may use a different label; needs testing post-first-deploy.
- `next`, `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js` pinned to `"latest"` in `package.json` — any `npm install` will silently bump these; only `package-lock.json` guards stability. Consider pinning to exact versions in a future hardening pass.
